	// The exit code is a numeric value that indicates the success or failure of the program.
	// A common convention is to use 0 for success and non-zero values for different types of errors.
	// For example, you might use 1 for a general error, 2 for a file not found error, etc.
	// In this example, we will use os.Exit(1) to indicate an error.
	// The os.Exit function does not return, so any code after it will not be executed.
