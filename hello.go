func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}

// Explanation:
// This is a simple Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// It demonstrates the basic structure of a Go program, including the main package and the main function.
// The main function is the entry point of the program, and the fmt package is used for formatted I/O.
// The Println function is used to print the string to the console, followed by a newline character.
// This program can be run using the Go command line tool, and it will output "Hello, World!" to the console.
// To run this program, save it in a file named hello.go and use the command `go run hello.go` in the terminal.
// This will compile and execute the program, displaying the output in the terminal.
// The program can also be compiled into a binary executable using the command `go build hello.go`,
// which will create an executable file named hello (or hello.exe on Windows).
// This executable can then be run directly from the terminal without needing to use the Go command.
// The Go programming language is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it a popular choice for building web servers, command-line tools, and other applications.
// The "Hello, World!" program is often used as a first program in many programming languages,
// serving as a simple introduction to the syntax and structure of the language.
// In Go, the main function is defined with the `func` keyword, followed by the function name `main`.
// The parentheses `()` indicate that this function does not take any parameters.
// The function body is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and contains the code that will be executed when the program runs.
// The `fmt` package is part of the Go standard library and provides functions for formatted I/O.
// The `Println` function is used to print a line of text to the standard output, which is typically the console.
// The string "Hello, World!" is passed as an argument to the Println function,
// and it will be displayed on the screen when the program is executed.
// This program serves as a simple introduction to the Go programming language and its syntax.
// It demonstrates how to define a package, import necessary libraries, and create a main function.
// The "Hello, World!" program is a common starting point for learning new programming languages,
// and it helps to familiarize oneself with the basic structure and syntax of the language.
// In summary, this Go program prints "Hello, World!" to the console,
// showcasing the basic syntax and structure of a Go program.
// It serves as a simple introduction to the Go programming language and its features.


// What is the purpose of package main in Go?

// The package main in Go indicates that the file is part of the main package,
// which is the entry point for the Go program. It tells the Go compiler that this package should be compiled as an executable program.
// The main package must contain a main function, which is the starting point of the program.
// When the program is executed, the Go runtime looks for the main function in the main package and starts executing the code from there.
// The main package is used to create standalone executable programs,
// while other packages can be used to define reusable libraries or modules.


// What if we declare main package in a different file?

// If we declare the main package in a different file, it will still be part of the same program,
// as long as all the files are in the same directory and are compiled together.
// The Go compiler treats all files in the same directory as part of the same package,
// so you can have multiple files with the main package in the same directory.
// However, there can only be one main function in the main package across all files.
// If you have multiple files with the main package, they will be compiled together,
// and the Go compiler will look for the main function in any of those files.
// If there are multiple main functions in different files, the compiler will raise an error,
// indicating that there are multiple entry points for the program.
// To avoid this, you should ensure that only one file contains the main function in the main package.
// You can organize your code into multiple files for better readability and maintainability,
// but make sure that only one file contains the main function.
// This allows you to split your code into smaller, more manageable pieces while still having a single entry point for the program.
// In summary, declaring the main package in a different file is allowed,
// but you must ensure that only one file contains the main function to avoid compilation errors.

// Why do we use go run when we can use go build?
// The go run command is used to compile and run Go programs in a single step,
// while the go build command is used to compile the program and create an executable binary file.
// The go run command is convenient for quickly testing and running Go programs without creating a separate binary file.
// It compiles the specified Go source files and runs the resulting executable in one command.
// This is particularly useful for small programs or during development when you want to quickly test changes.
// The go build command, on the other hand, creates a binary executable file,
// which can be run independently of the Go toolchain.
// This is useful for larger projects or when you want to distribute the program as a standalone executable.
// The go build command generates an executable file in the current directory,
// which can be run directly from the command line.
// The go build command also allows you to specify build flags and options,
// such as setting the output file name or building for a specific operating system or architecture.
// In summary, the go run command is used for quick testing and running Go programs,
// while the go build command is used to create standalone executable binaries.
// Both commands serve different purposes and can be used based on the needs of the developer.
// The go run command is more convenient for development and testing,
// while the go build command is more suitable for production and distribution.
// The go run command is particularly useful for small programs or during development,
// where you want to quickly test changes without creating a separate binary file.


// So, the best way to run a Go program is to use go run for quick testing and development,
// and go build for creating standalone executables for production or distribution.

// Summary:
// - The package main indicates that the file is part of the main package,
//   which is the entry point for the Go program.
// - The main function is the starting point of the program and must be defined in the main package.
// - You can have multiple files with the main package in the same directory,
//   but only one file should contain the main function to avoid compilation errors.
// - The go run command is used for quick testing and running Go programs,
//   while the go build command is used to create standalone executable binaries.
// - Use go run for development and testing, and go build for creating executables for production 
// 	 or distribution(do go build when we are finally ready).
